<p><h3>Apollo 13</h3></p>
<p>As a kid I remember this event happening. However, at the age of 9, I didn't really understand what actually happened. When this film came out 25 years after the event itself, I was engrossed! </p>
<h3>Aladdin</h3>
<p>One of the first of the 'new generation' of Disney animations that my daughter engaged with (together with The Little Mermaid and Beauty And The Beast).</p>
<h3>All Of Us Strangers</h3>
</p>A beautifully sad love story of two lonely guys. The film explores the effects of loneliness on mental health with an LGBT+ theme.
